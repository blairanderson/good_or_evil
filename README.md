Good Or Evil (news map)
=================

Why?

I love the internet, but often people will lazily link to articles without caring for the source. 
I believe in putting my time/money where my mouth is. 

The goal of this project:

- allow users to define which sources they believe are "Good" or "Evil" in their own mind. 
- allow users to submit "Evil" links, and be shown quickly to "Good" replacements
- allow users on chrome to see a notification "View Good Source?" if they visit an "Evil" site.
- no "user tracking and selling user data" - just showing alternative sources for links that are provided.
