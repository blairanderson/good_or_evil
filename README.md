WireCutter Clone
=================
- [ ] adding an item without a brand creates a brand of the domain name.
- [ ] list should be sortable with drag/drop

Why?

I've always loved wirecutter, specifically organized data and content about things.
I'm probably underestimating the value of the content, but I wanted a simple way to save sharable lists of things. I was also motivated by a friend that wanted to create sharable lists for tutorials and routines.

we currently have 'reviews' which should probably be changed to 'lists'

lists have many items. the user can write a top-level description, then add another description/reason for adding the specific item to their list.
